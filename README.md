# Movie Recommender System

The Movie Recommender System is a Python application designed to help users discover movies tailored to their preferences. This system leverages the power of data analysis and natural language processing using Python libraries such as pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, CountVectorizer, and NLTK. By processing user inputs and movie data, it provides personalized movie recommendations.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python installed on your system. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).

Install the required libraries using the following command:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn nltk
```

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/KiranGangoor0301/MovieRecommenderSystem.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory:**

   ```bash
   cd MovieRecommenderSystem
   ```

3. **Run the Recommender System:**

   ```bash
   python MovieRecommenderSystem.py
   ```

4. **Input Your Preferences:**

   Follow the on-screen instructions to enter your movie preferences and receive personalized recommendations.

## How it Works

1. **Data Collection and Preprocessing:**

   - Movie data, including titles and genres, is collected and processed using pandas and numpy for cleaning and organization.
   - Text data (movie titles and genres) is transformed into numerical features using CountVectorizer from scikit-learn.

2. **Recommendation Algorithm:**

   - The system employs a recommendation algorithm from scikit-learn to suggest movies based on user preferences.
   - Natural Language Processing tasks, such as tokenization and stopword removal, are performed using NLTK to enhance recommendation accuracy.

3. **User Interaction:**

   - Users interact with the system through the command line interface, inputting their movie preferences.
